^-?\d*\.?\d+$

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the regular expression means:

^: matches the beginning of the string.
-?: matches an optional minus sign.
\d*: matches zero or more digits.
\.?: matches an optional decimal point.
\d+: matches one or more digits.
$: matches the end of the string.

So this regular expression will match numbers such as 123, -456, 3.14, and -0.5, but not non-numeric strings such as abc, 123a, or 1.2.3.
